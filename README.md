## About
This project was developed as a school assignment to practice desktop application development with C# and Windows Forms.

The goal was to recreate the classic Minesweeper game logic, grid handling, and user interactions in a native Windows environment rather than focusing on modern UI frameworks.

The entire project is written in Turkish, as it was developed for a school course.
